				<h1> About Battle ship</h1>
				<p> Battleship is a very popular battle game, played all over the world in different forms and with different rules. 
				The original battleship game was played with paper and pencil, invented by Clifford Von Wickler before World War I. Back then, 
				the game was not called Battleship but Salvo. <p><p>While people still play this battle game with a paper and pencil, 
				it is also played as a board game, a video game, a computer game and an online game. Because of its simplicity, 
				Battleship is a great game for children of all ages. Playing the game with a computer-controlled opponent allows 
				children to make mistakes while learning how to play the game. After the child is confident enough to play against 
				siblings or adults, the entire family can have fun playing the game together and benefit from family time.</p>
